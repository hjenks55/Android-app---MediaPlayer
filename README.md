# MediaPlayer
This app was developed for one of my programming units at uni. It was a really fun app to code and is pretty much a Media Player
like itunes that has a simple menu that allows users to browse movies and playlists which are in the form of an external txt file.
Users can list these files, sort, and edit.

MediaPlayer was developed on Eclipse 4.6.0
